# 🧩 Maze_Solver

Welcome to the **Maze_Solver** — a cutting-edge exploration into **procedural maze generation** and **intelligent NPC pathfinding** built with **C++** and visualized through the powerful **Unreal Engine**!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project dives deep into game algorithms, bringing together:

- **Procedural Maze Generation:** Create complex labyrinths dynamically every run.
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm:** Enable NPCs to find the *optimal* path through the maze.
- **Unreal Engine Visualization:** See your maze and NPCs come to life in stunning 3D, with debug tools to track pathfinding decisions in real-time.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Dynamic maze layout generation based on configurable parameters  
- Efficient and reliable A* search algorithm for NPC navigation  
- Visual debugging: display paths, nodes, and decision points inside Unreal  
- Modular C++ code, ready for extension and optimization  

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
