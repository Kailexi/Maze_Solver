# 🧩 Maze_Solver

Welcome to the **Maze_Solver** — an exploration into **procedural maze generation** and **intelligent NPC pathfinding** built with **C++** and visualized through the powerful **Unreal Engine**!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project dives deep into game algorithms, bringing together:

- **Procedural Maze Generation:** Create complex labyrinths dynamically every run.
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm:** Enable NPCs to find the *optimal* path through the maze.
- **Unreal Engine Visualization:** See your maze and NPCs come to life in stunning 3D, with debug tools to track pathfinding decisions in real-time.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Dynamic maze layout generation based on configurable parameters  
- Efficient and reliable A* search algorithm for NPC navigation  
- Visual debugging: display paths, nodes, and decision points inside Unreal  
- Modular C++ code, ready for extension and optimization  

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unreal Engine 5.x (recommended latest stable release)  
- Visual Studio 2019/2022 with C++ development tools installed  
- Git for version control  

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kailexi/Maze_Solver.git

2. **Open the project**
    Launch Unreal Engine and open the .uproject file.

3. **Build**
     Use Visual Studio to compile the C++ source files.

4. **Run**
    Start the project and watch your NPCs navigate through the procedurally generated maze!
